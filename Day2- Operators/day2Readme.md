# Day 2: Operator

## Tasks/Activities:

#### Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

- **Task 1:** Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 2:** Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 3:** Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 4:** Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
- **Task 5:** Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
  
#### Activity 2: Assignment Operators

- **Task 6:** Use the <code> +=</code> operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
- **Task 7:** Use the <code> -=</code> operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 3: Comparison Operators

- **Task 8:** Write a program to compare two numbers using <code> > </code> and <code> < </code> and log the result to the console.
- **Task 9:** Write a program to compare two numbers using <code> >= </code> and <code> <= </code> and log the result to the console.
- **Task 10:** Write a program to compare two numbers using <code> == </code> and <code> === </code> and log the result to the console.
  
#### Activity 4: Logical Operators

- **Task 11:** Write a program that uses the <code>&&</code> operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 12:** Write a program that uses the <code> || </code> operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
- **Task 13:** Write a program that uses the <code> ! </code> operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

#### Activity 5: Ternary Operators

- **Task 14:** Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
  
## Feature Request:

1. **Arithmetic Operations Script:** Write  a script that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder) on two number and log the results to the console.
2. **Comparison and Logical Operator Script:** Create a script that compare two numbers using different comparison operators and combines conditions using logical operators, logging the results.
3. **Ternary Operator Script:** Write a script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is positive or negative and logs the result.
   
## Achievement:

By the end of these activities, students will:
- Understand and use of arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
- Compare values using comparison operators.
- Combine conditions using logical operators.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
