# 30 Days JavaScript Challenge

## By the end of these activities, you will:

### Day 1 : Variable and Data Types
- Know how to declare variables using <code> var</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>const</code>.
- Understanding the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the <code>typeof</code> operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of <code> const</code> variables.

### Day 2 : Operators
- Understand and use of arithmetic operators to perform basic calculations.
- Use assignment operators to modify variable values.
- Compare values using comarison operators.
- Combine conditions using logical operators.
- Use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.

### Day 3 : Control Structure
- Implement and understand basic if-else control flow.
- use nested if-else statements to handle multiple conditions.
- Utilize switch cases forr control flow based on specific values.
- Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
- Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.

### Day 4 : Loops
- Understand and use for loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers.
- Utilize while loops for iteration based on a condition.
- Apply do...while loops to ensure the loop body is executed at least once.
- Implement nested loops to solve more complex problems.
- Use loop control statements (<code> break </code> and <code> continue </code>) to control the flow of loops.

### Day 5 : Functions
- Understand and define functions using function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
- Use function parameters and default values effectively.
- Create and utilize higher-order functions.
- Apply functions to solve common problems and perform calculations.
- Enhance code reusability and organization using functions.

### Day 6 : Arrays
- Create and manipulate arrays using various methods.
- Transform and aggregate array data using <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code> and <code>reduce</code>.
- Iterate over arrays using loops and iteration methods.
- Understand and work with multi-dimensional arrays.

### Day 7 : Objects
- Create and manipulate objects with properties and methods.
- Understand and use the <code>this</code> keyword in object methods.
- Work with nested objects and arrays of objects.
- Iterate over an object's properties using loops and built-in methods.
